# Experiments

This folder serves as a central hub for publishing various experiments conducted with different components. The primary focus of these experiments is to test the functionality of these components and assess the quality of the data they produce with respect to the needs of the overall project. 

Each experiment should be carefully designed to evaluate specific aspects of the electronic, mechanical, and software needs of the product, providing insights and aiming to provide a complete understanding of the overall performance and reliability 

In cases where experiments involve multiple components simultaneously, the focus extends beyond individual component functionality. These experiments are designed to assess the interplay and relationship between different components within the software application. This approach is useful for understanding how components interact and impact each other in a real-world application context and therefore giving hints on how to develop the software architecture.
